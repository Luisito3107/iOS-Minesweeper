# Minesweeper Game for iOS

A simple and interactive Minesweeper game app for iOS, built using Xcode. The app features a dynamic board implemented with `UICollectionView` that allows for customizable board dimensions (1:1 ratio) through the `ViewController` file code.

## Features
- **Dynamic Board**: The board dimensions can be adjusted from the `ViewController` file, maintaining a 1:1 aspect ratio.
